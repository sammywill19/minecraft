        <h3>Step 1: Gathering Resources</h3>
        <p>When you first enter the world, start by collecting basic resources like wood, dirt, and stone. Punch trees to gather wood and use it to craft your initial tools. Remember, everything in Minecraft begins with wood!</p>

        <h3>Step 6: Farming</h3>
        <p>Start a farm near your base to ensure a steady food supply. Collect seeds by breaking grass, then plant them on tilled soil near water. Over time, you can expand your farm to include carrots, potatoes, and more.</p>
